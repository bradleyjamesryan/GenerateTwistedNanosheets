## Generate Twisted Nanosheets
This MATLAB script will take a POSCAR file containing two sheets, and rotate the top sheet a user-defined angle, translate the sheet at a user-defined distance, generate vacuum spacing around the sheet, terminate unsturated bonds with hydrogens, and save a new POSCAR file.

Note that this code is written specifically for two-dimensional sp3 hybridized monolayers (e.g., graphgane, silicane, germanane, stanane, and plumbane)
